These are sidecars that run in the same pod as your application you configured it with. Code Server \u00b6 The code-server add-on can be used to access and modify persistent volume data in your application. This can be useful when you need to edit the persistent volume data, for example with Home Assistant. Example values \u00b6 Below is a snippet from a values.yaml using the add-on.

Types \u00b6 These are the types of storage that are supported in the common library. Of course, other types are possible with the custom type. Persistent Volume Claim \u00b6 This is probably the most common storage type, therefore it is also the default when no type is specified. It can be attached in two ways. Dynamically provisioned \u00b6 Charts can be configured to create the required persistentVolumeClaim manifests on the fly. Field Mandatory Docs / Description enabled Yes type Yes accessMode Yes link size Yes link mountPath No Where to mount the volume in the main container. Defaults to /<name_of_the_volume> . readOnly No Specify if the volume should be mounted read-only. nameOverride No Override the name suffix that is used for this volume. storageClass No Storage class to use for this volume. retain No Set to true to retain the PVC upon helm uninstall . Minimal config: persistence : config : enabled : true type : pvc accessMode : ReadWriteOnce size : 1Gi This will create a 1Gi RWO PVC named RELEASE-NAME-config with the default storageClass, which will mount to /config . Existing claim \u00b6 Charts can be configured to attach to a pre-existing persistentVolumeClaim. Field Mandatory Docs / Description enabled Yes type Yes existingClaim Yes Name of the existing PVC mountPath No Where to mount the volume in the main container. Defaults to /<name_of_the_volume> . subPath No Specifies a sub-path inside the referenced volume instead of its root. readOnly No Specify if the volume should be mounted read-only. nameOverride No Override the name suffix that is used for this volume. Minimal config: persistence : config : enabled : true type : pvc existingClaim : myAppData This will mount an existing PVC named myAppData to /config . Empty Dir \u00b6 Sometimes you need to share some data between containers, or need some scratch space. That is where an emptyDir can come in. See the Kubernetes docs for more information. Field Mandatory Docs / Description enabled Yes type Yes medium No Set this to Memory to mount a tmpfs (RAM-backed filesystem) instead of the storage medium that backs the node. sizeLimit No If the SizeMemoryBackedVolumes feature gate is enabled, you can specify a size for memory backed volumes. mountPath No Where to mount the volume in the main container. Defaults to /<name_of_the_volume> . nameOverride No Override the name suffix that is used for this volume. Minimal config: persistence : config : enabled : true type : emptyDir This will create an ephemeral emptyDir volume and mount it to /config . Host path \u00b6 In order to mount a path from the node where the Pod is running you can use a hostPath type persistence item. This can also be used to mount an attached USB device to a Pod. Note that this will most likely also require setting an elevated securityContext . See the Kubernetes docs for more information. Field Mandatory Docs / Description enabled Yes type Yes hostPath Yes Which path on the host should be mounted. hostPathType No Specifying a hostPathType adds a check before trying to mount the path. See Kubernetes documentation for options. mountPath No Where to mount the volume in the main container. Defaults to the value of hostPath . readOnly No Specify if the volume should be mounted read-only. nameOverride No Override the name suffix that is used for this volume. Minimal config: persistence : config : enabled : true type : hostPath hostPath : /dev This will mount the /dev folder from the underlying host to /dev in the container. configMap \u00b6 In order to mount a configMap to a mount point within the Pod you can use the configMap type persistence item. Field Mandatory Docs / Description enabled Yes type Yes name Yes Which configMap should be mounted. Supports Helm templating. defaultMode No The default file access permission bit. items No Specify item-specific configuration. Will be passed 1:1 to the volumeSpec. readOnly No Explicitly specify if the volume should be mounted read-only. Even if not specified, the configMap will be read-only. Minimal config: persistence : config : enabled : true type : configMap name : mySettings This will mount the contents of the pre-existing mySettings configMap to /config . Secret \u00b6 In order to mount a Secret to a mount point within the Pod you can use the secret type persistence item. Field Mandatory Docs / Description enabled Yes type Yes name Yes Which Secret should be mounted. Supports Helm templating. defaultMode No The default file access permission bit. items No Specify item-specific configuration. Will be passed 1:1 to the volumeSpec. readOnly No Explicitly specify if the volume should be mounted read-only. Even if not specified, the Secret will be read-only. Minimal config: persistence : config : enabled : true type : secret name : mySecret This will mount the contents of the pre-existing mySecret Secret to /config . NFS Volume \u00b6 To mount an NFS share to your Pod you can either pre-create a persistentVolumeClaim referring to it, or you can specify an inline NFS volume: Note Mounting an NFS share this way does not allow for specifying mount options. If you require these, you must create a PVC to mount the share. Field Mandatory Docs / Description enabled Yes type Yes server Yes Host name or IP address of the NFS server. path Yes The path on the server to mount. readOnly No Explicitly specify if the volume should be mounted read-only. Even if not specified, the Secret will be read-only. Minimal config: persistence : config : enabled : true type : nfs server : 10.10.0.8 path : /tank/nas/library This will mount the NFS share /tank/nas/library on server 10.10.0.8 to /config . Custom \u00b6 When you wish to specify a custom volume, you can use the custom type. This can be used for example to mount configMap or Secret objects. See the Kubernetes docs for more information. Field Mandatory Docs / Description enabled Yes type Yes volumeSpec Yes Define the raw Volume spec here. mountPath No Where to mount the volume in the main container. Defaults to the value of hostPath . readOnly No Specify if the volume should be mounted read-only. nameOverride No Override the name suffix that is used for this volume. Permissions \u00b6 Charts do not modify file or folder permissions on volumes out of the box. This means that you will have to make sure that your storage can be written to by the application. Multiple subPaths for 1 volume \u00b6 It is possible to mount multiple subPaths from the same volume to the main container. This can be achieved by specifying subPath with a list instead of a string. Note It is not possible to define mountPath at the top level when using this feature Examples: persistence : config : enabled : true type : custom volumeSpec : configMap : name : myData subPath : - path : myFirstScript.sh mountPath : /data/myFirstScript.sh - path : myCertificate.pem mountPath : /certs/myCertificate.pem readOnly : true persistence : config : enabled : true type : pvc existingClaim : myAppData subPath : - path : . mountPath : /my_media - path : Series mountPath : /series - path : Downloads mountPath : /downloads","title":"Common Storage"},{"location":"common-library/common-library-storage/#common-library-storage","text":"This page describes the different ways you can attach storage to charts using the common library.","title":"Common library Storage"},{"location":"common-library/common-library-storage/#types","text":"These are the types of storage that are supported in the common library.

See the app template for an example how to deploy it. Background \u00b6 In Helm 3, their team introduced the concept of a Library chart . A library chart is a type of Helm chart that defines chart primitives or definitions which can be shared by Helm templates in other charts. This allows users to share snippets of code that can be re-used across charts, avoiding repetition and keeping charts DRY. The common library was created because I saw many charts requiring only a few select configuration options in their Helm charts. Note Take one of the many applications like sonarr or nzbget . Each of these charts only require setting service , port , persistence , ingress and image since state and app configuration is handled by the application itself. In order to stay somewhat DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and keeping with Helm 3 usage for a Library chart, I saw this pattern and decided it was worth it to create a library. This means each one of these app charts has a dependency on what we call the common library.
