# app-template

![Version: 2.0.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-2.0.1-informational?style=flat-square)

A common powered chart template. This can be useful for small projects that don't have their own chart.

## Requirements

Kubernetes: `>=1.22.0-0`

## Dependencies

| Repository | Name | Version |
|------------|------|---------|
| https://bjw-s.github.io/helm-charts | common | 2.0.1 |

## Installing the Chart

```bash
# Add the repository
helm repo add bjw-s https://bjw-s.github.io/helm-charts/

# Install the chart
helm install bjw-s app-template -f values.yaml
```

## Configuration

Read through the [values.yaml](../../library/common/values.yaml) file of the [common library](../../library/common/) chart. It has several commented out suggested values.
The [CI tests](../../library/common-test/ci) contain a number of scenarios that may prove useful as well.

## Upgrade instructions

### From 1.x.x to 2.0.x

> :warning: **IMPORTANT** Because a new label has been introduced in the controller labelSelector (which is an immutable field), Deployments cannot be upgraded in place!

Given the following real-life example values.yaml for app-template v1:

<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>

```yaml
image:
  repository: ghcr.io/onedr0p/sabnzbd
  tag: latest
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

podSecurityContext:
  runAsUser: 568
  runAsGroup: 568
  fsGroup: 568
  fsGroupChangePolicy: "OnRootMismatch"
  supplementalGroups:
    - 65539

service:
  main:
    ports:
      http:
        port: 8080

ingress:
  main:
    enabled: true
    ingressClassName: "ingress-nginx"
    hosts:
      - host: sabnzbd.bjw-s.dev
        paths:
          - path: /

persistence:
  media:
    enabled: true
    existingClaim: nas-media
    mountPath: /data/nas-media

probes:
  liveness:
    enabled: false
  readiness:
    enabled: false
  startup:
    enabled: false
```

</details>

The values for app-template v2.x would become this:

```yaml
defaultPodOptions:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 568
    runAsGroup: 568
    fsGroup: 568
    fsGroupChangePolicy: "OnRootMismatch"
    supplementalGroups:
      - 65539

controllers:
  main:
    containers:
      main:
        image:
          repository: ghcr.io/onedr0p/sabnzbd
          tag: latest
          pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

        probes:
          liveness:
            enabled: false
          readiness:
            enabled: false
          startup:
            enabled: false

service:
  main:
    ports:
      http:
        port: 8080

ingress:
  main:
    enabled: true
    className: "ingress-nginx"
    hosts:
      - host: sabnzbd.bjw-s.dev
        paths:
          - path: /
            service:
              name: main
              port: http

persistence:
  media:
    existingClaim: nas-media
    globalMounts:
      - path: /data/nas-media
```

#### Changes in this example

This is not meant as an exhaustive list of changes, but rather a "most common" example.

- `podSecurityContext` has been moved to `defaultPodOptions.securityContext`. It is also possible to configure this on a controller-specific basis by moving it to `controllers.main.pod.securityContext` instead.
- `image` has been moved to `controllers.main.containers.main.image` so that multiple containers can be configured.
- `ingress.main.ingressClassName` has been renamed to `ingress.main.className`.
- `ingress.main.enabled` can be removed, since items are considered enabled by default (they can still be disabled by adding `enabled: false`).
- `ingress.main.hosts.*.paths.*.service` is now required since there is no more concept of a default "primary" service.
- `persistence.media.mountPath` has been moved to `persistence.media.globalMounts.*.path` to allow multiple mountPaths for the same persistence item.
- `persistence.media.enabled` can be removed, since items are considered enabled by default (they can still be disabled by adding `enabled: false`).
- `probes` has been moved to `controllers.main.containers.main.probes` so that multiple containers can be configured.
