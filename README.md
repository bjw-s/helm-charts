# helm-charts
A collection of Helm charts

## Goal

This repo contains Helm charts that I have developed to run applications in my
[home Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/bjw-s/home-ops/).

This repo is not intended to be a replacement for any of the large collections
of Helm charts that are out there.

## Installation

The Helm repository can be installed as follows:

```console
helm repo add bjw-s https://bjw-s.github.io/helm-charts
```

You can then run `helm search repo bjw-s` to search the charts.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found [here](https://bjw-s.github.io/helm-charts/docs/).
